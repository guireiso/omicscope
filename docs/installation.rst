Installation
============

Use the following command in the command line::

    pip install omicscope

**Note:** *OmicScope* uses the package SciPy, which requires a fortran compiler to be installed to build its source,
 which can be tricky on some systems. An alternative to this is to use Anaconda environment. 
 OmicScope can then be more easily installed within this environment, using the command line or preferred method.
