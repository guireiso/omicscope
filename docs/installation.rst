Installation
============

Use the following command in the command line::

    pip install omicscope

**Note:** *OmicScope* uses the package SciPy, which requires a fortran compiler to be installed to build its source, which can be tricky on some systems. An alternative to this is to use Anaconda environment (https://www.anaconda.com/download). OmicScope can then be more easily installed within this environment, using the command line or preferred method.
